                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek the root of f (x). Choose two initial points C1 (x1; y1)
                    and C2 (x2; y2) and draw through them directly. It crosses the x-axis at the point
                    (x3; 0). Now we find the value function with the abscissa x3. Temporarily, we assume
                    x3 root on the interval [x1; x2]. Suppose that C3 has abstsisu x3 and lies on the
                    graph. Now, instead of points C1 and C2, we take the point of C3 and the point C2.
                    Now with these two points do the tighter operation and so on, ie will receive two
                    points of Cn + 1, and Cn and repeat the operation with them. Thus we will get two
                    points, the segment connecting that crosses the x-axis at the point, the value of
                    the abscissa which can be approximated by the roots. These actions need to be repeated
                    until we get the value of the root with the right approach to us.</p>

                    Let x1, x2 - abscissa ends of the chord, y = kx + b - equation of the line containing
                    the chord. We find the coefficients k and b of the system of equations:</p>
                f(x1)=kx1+b f(x2)=kx2+b
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subtract from the first equation of the second: f (x1) - f (x2)
                    = k (x1 - x2), then find the coefficients k and b:</p>
                k=(f(x2)-f(x1)/(x2-x1)) then b=f(x1)-(f(x2)-f(x1)*x1/(x2-x1))
                <p>
                    The equation becomes:</p>
                y=(f(x2)-f(x1)/(x2-x1))*(x-x1)+f(x1)
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, now we can find a first approximation to the root, obtained
                    by the method of chords:</p>
                x3=x1-)(x2-x1)*f(x1))/(f(x2)-f(x1))
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we take the coordinates x2 and x3, and everything was done
                    to repeat the operation, finding a new approach to the root. Repeat the operation
                    should be up until xn - xn - 1 can not be less than or equal to the value of the
                    error.</p>

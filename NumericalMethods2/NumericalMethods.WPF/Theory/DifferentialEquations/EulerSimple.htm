                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method, named
                    after Leonhard Euler, is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary
                    differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic kind
                    of explicit method for numerical integration for ordinary differential equations.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the problem of calculating the shape of an unknown curve
                    which starts at a given point and satisfies a given differential equation. Here,
                    a differential equation can be thought of as a formula by which the slope of the
                    tangent line to the curve can be computed at any point on the curve, once the position
                    of that point has been calculated. The idea is that while the curve is initially
                    unknown, its starting point, which we denote by A0, is known (see the picture on
                    top right). Then, from the differential equation, the slope to the curve at A0 can
                    be computed, and so, the tangent line. Take a small step along that tangent line
                    up to a point A1. If we pretend that A1 is still on the curve, the same reasoning
                    as for the point A0 above can be used. After several steps, a polygonal curve is
                    computed. In general, this curve does not diverge too far from the original unknown
                    curve, and the error between the two curves can be made small if the step size is
                    small enough and the interval of computation is finite (although things are more
                    complicated for stiff equations, as discussed below).</p>

                    <b><b>Derivation</b></b></p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to approximate the solution of the initial value problem
                    y'(t)=f(t,y(t)), y(t0)=y0 by using the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of
                    y, which represents the linear approximation around the point (t0,y(t0)) . One step
                    of the Euler method from tn to tn+1 = tn + h is
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yn+1=Yn+hf(Tn,Yn)</p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Euler method is explicit, i.e. the solution Yn+1 is an explicit
                function of Yi for .
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Euler method integrates a first order ODE, any ODE of
                    order N can be represented as a first-order ODE in more than one variable by introducing
                    N − 1 further variables, y', y'', ..., y(N), and formulating N first order equations
                    in these new variables. The Euler method can be applied to the vector
                </p>
                <p>
                    y(t)=(y(t),y'(t),y"(t),..,y^(n)(t)) to integrate the higher-order system.</p>
